        <div class="panel">
          I tend towards the following habits; they provide an outline of how I like to work. <br/><br/> 

          <ul>
            <li>I ask lots of questions. Sometimes, too many! Though I often prefer consulting good documentation.</li>
            <li>I love to design systems and architectures, though I get itchy fingers if I haven't coded in a while.</li>
            <li>So far, I have chosen adaptability over specialisation. I learn fast, but I'm not a world-leading expert in one area.</li> 
            <li>I believe strongly in developing the 'softer skills'. I like to present, discuss ideas, and build useful relationships.</li>
            <li>I value personal connections. It matters to me that my colleagues are happy, and I will work in aid of that goal.</li>
            <li>I engage actively in performance review processes, since I believe them to be extemely valuable if done right.</li>
            <li>The trait I value most highly is <b>pragmatism</b>. I am rarely stuck in my ways, and I hope to see that in others.</li>
          </ul>

          For a broader picture of my personality, the description of the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">ENFP personality type</a> doesn't do a bad job!<br/><br/>

          <p>From ages 11-18 I was a member of a boxing club in my hometown. I don't box competitively, but it's still my main fitness outlet, and one of the pursuits I most credit with teaching me discipline and perseverence. I still follow the sport pretty closely, too.</p>

          <p>I am an avid Liverpool FC fan, as are many from the little merseyside peninsula I was born and raised on. Wherever I am, I find a way to get back to Anfield at least a couple of times a year. I was lucky enough to be in the stands for <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11945/11984568/liverpool-4-0-barcelona-stunning-reds-comeback-revisited">this game</a>!</p>

          <p>I play the guitar, having learned during 2020 by following Paul Davids' "<a href="https://learnpracticeplay.com/signup/">Learn, Practice, Play</a>" course. I mostly play music that predates me by a few decades...</p>
